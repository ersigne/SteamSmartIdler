## üöÄ„ÉªUsage
1. Create a new `index.js` or use the one provided below:

```js
    // Example index.js
    const fs = require('fs');
    const SteamSmartIdler = require('./SteamSmartIdler/classes/SteamSmartIdler');
    
    // Config
    const accounts = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('./config.json', 'utf8')).accounts;
    let delayBetweenLoginsinSeconds = -1; // {-1} - Sets a Random Sleep Timer between 1-5 seconds
    
    async function run() {
        console.clear();
        for (const [index, account] of Object.entries(accounts)) {
            // Create a new SteamSmartidler passing to it an account and a list of Free Promotion Packages SubIDs - See https://steamdb.info/upcoming/free/
            const idler = new SteamSmartIdler(account, [1261257]);
            idler.start();
            
            // Sleep after each login for a random time between 1-5 seconds if delayBetweenLoginsinSeconds is set to -1 or sleep delayBetweenLoginsinSeconds seconds.
            if (index < Object.keys(accounts).length - 1) {
                delayBetweenLoginsinSeconds = delayBetweenLoginsinSeconds === -1 ? (Math.floor(Math.random() * 5) + 1) : delayBetweenLoginsinSeconds;
                await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delayBetweenLoginsinSeconds * 1000));
            }
        }
    }
    
    run();

We welcome contributions to the SteamSmartIdler project! If you'd like to help out, please follow these guidelines:

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page on GitHub (or your chosen platform). This will create a copy of the project under your own account.

2.  **Create a New Branch:** Before making any changes, create a new branch from the `main` branch. This helps keep your contributions organized and separate from the main codebase.

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-new-feature
    # or
    git checkout -b bugfix/your-bug-fix
    ```

    Replace `feature/your-new-feature` or `bugfix/your-bug-fix` with a descriptive name for your branch.

3.  **Make Your Changes:** Implement your desired features, bug fixes, or improvements. Please adhere to any existing code style and conventions within the project.

4.  **Commit Your Changes:** Once you've made your changes, commit them with clear and concise commit messages. Follow best practices for writing commit messages (e.g., a short summary in the first line, followed by a more detailed explanation if necessary).

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Implement [brief description of feature]"
    # or
    git commit -m "Fix [brief description of bug]"
    ```

5.  **Push to Your Fork:** Push your local branch to your forked repository on GitHub (or your platform).

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-new-feature
    ```

    Replace `feature/your-new-feature` with the name of your branch.

6. **Create a Pull Request (PR):**
  * Go to the main repository page on GitHub (the `SteamSmartIdler` repository).
  * Click the "Pull requests" tab.
  * Click the "New pull request" button.
  * Select your forked repository and the branch you just pushed as the "compare branch."
  * Ensure the base branch is correctly set to the `main` branch of the main repository.
  * Provide a clear title and a detailed description of your changes in the pull request. Explain the problem you're solving or the feature you're adding.
  * Click the "Create pull request" button.

7. **Code Review:** Your pull request will be reviewed by the project maintainers. They may provide feedback or request changes. Please be responsive to any comments and make the necessary adjustments.

8. **Merge:** Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main codebase. Congratulations on your contribution!
